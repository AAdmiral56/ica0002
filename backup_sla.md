# Backup coverage
In the backup procedure following services are backed up:
- MySQL database - AAdmiral56-2
- Grafana - AAdmiral56-3

Backups are issued for these two services, since Grafana is a monitoring service, which will assist in revitalizing should the entire service or parts of it stop functioning.

MySQL database includes customer data, which is vital to the recovery of this infrastructure, thus it is important that we keep the database safe.
